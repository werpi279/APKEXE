# APKEXE
All the .apk and .exe files I've made through the years. (The ones that I could find/survived)

You can find:
- games
- AR showcasing app
- VR/cardboard experiences
- test and experiment
- build from other repos here on github

Download, install and point (some of) them to the marker inside the "marker" folder.

All the version I could find.
Some may work in the wrong way.
